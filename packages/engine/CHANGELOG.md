# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.72.1] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Changed the default engine transport to `auto` so providers can use their best available transport by default ([#4083](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/4083)).

## [0.72.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `shouldStopAfterTurn` to the low-level engine loop config for gracefully exiting after a completed turn before polling queued messages or starting another Provider call.

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated public TypeBox-facing types and examples from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x to `typebox` 1.x. Install and import from `typebox` instead of relying on `@sinclair/typebox` transitively ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/3112))

### Added

- Added `terminate: true` tool-result hints to skip the automatic follow-up Provider call when every finalized tool result in the current batch opts into early termination ([#3525](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/3525))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `streamProxy()` to preserve the proxy-safe serializable subset of stream options, including session, transport, retry-delay, metadata, header, cache-retention, and thinking-budget settings ([#3512](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/3512))
- Fixed parallel tool execution to emit `tool_execution_end` as soon as each tool is finalized, while still emitting persisted tool-result messages in assistant source order ([#3503](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/3503))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- Clarified parallel tool execution ordering docs to specify that final tool lifecycle and tool-result artifacts are emitted in tool completion order.

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fixed parallel tool-call finalization to convert `afterToolCall` hook throws into error tool results instead of aborting the batch ([#3084](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/3084))

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Breaking Changes

- `EngineState` has been reshaped:
  - `streamMessage` was renamed to `streamingMessage`
  - `error` was renamed to `errorMessage`
  - `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` are now readonly in the public API
  - `pendingToolCalls` is now typed as `ReadonlySet<string>`
  - `tools` and `messages` are now accessor properties, and assigning either field copies the provided top-level array instead of preserving array identity
- `EngineOptions.initialState` no longer accepts runtime-owned fields. Remove `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` from `initialState` values.
- Removed `Engine` mutator methods in favor of direct property access:
  - `engine.setSystemPrompt(value)` -> `engine.state.systemPrompt = value`
  - `engine.setModel(model)` -> `engine.state.model = model`
  - `engine.setThinkingLevel(level)` -> `engine.state.thinkingLevel = level`
  - `engine.setTools(tools)` -> `engine.state.tools = tools`
  - `engine.replaceMessages(messages)` -> `engine.state.messages = messages`
  - `engine.appendMessage(message)` -> `engine.state.messages.push(message)`
  - `engine.clearMessages()` -> `engine.state.messages = []`
  - `engine.setToolExecution(mode)` -> `engine.toolExecution = mode`
  - `engine.setBeforeToolCall(fn)` -> `engine.beforeToolCall = fn`
  - `engine.setAfterToolCall(fn)` -> `engine.afterToolCall = fn`
  - `engine.setTransport(transport)` -> `engine.transport = transport`
- Removed queue mode getter/setter methods in favor of properties:
  - `engine.setSteeringMode(mode)` -> `engine.steeringMode = mode`
  - `engine.getSteeringMode()` -> `engine.steeringMode`
  - `engine.setFollowUpMode(mode)` -> `engine.followUpMode = mode`
  - `engine.getFollowUpMode()` -> `engine.followUpMode`
- `Engine.subscribe()` listeners are now awaited and receive the active `AbortSignal`:
  - `engine.subscribe((event) => { ... })` -> `engine.subscribe(async (event, signal) => { ... })`
  - `engine_end` is now the final emitted event for a run, but not the idle boundary
  - `engine.waitForIdle()`, `engine.prompt(...)`, and `engine.continue()` now settle only after awaited `engine_end` listeners finish
  - `engine.state.isStreaming` remains `true` until that settlement completes

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `EngineTool.prepareArguments` hook to prepare raw tool call arguments before schema validation, enabling compatibility shims for resumed sessions with outdated tool schemas

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `Engine.signal` to expose the active abort signal for the current turn, allowing callers to forward cancellation into nested async work ([#2660](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/2660))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fixed steering messages to wait until the current assistant message's tool-call batch fully finishes instead of skipping pending tool calls.

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hooks to `EngineOptions` and `EngineLoopConfig` for preflight blocking and post-execution tool result mutation.

### Changed

- Added configurable tool execution mode to `Engine` and `engineLoop` via `toolExecution: "parallel" | "sequential"`, with `parallel` as the default. Parallel mode preflights tool calls sequentially, executes allowed tools concurrently, and emits final tool results in assistant source order.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Breaking Changes

- **Queue API replaced with steer/followUp**: The `queueMessage()` method has been split into two methods with different delivery semantics ([#403](https://github.com/badlogic/Mooncli-mono/issues/403)):
  - `steer(msg)`: Interrupts the engine mid-run. Delivered after current tool execution, skips remaining tools.
  - `followUp(msg)`: Waits until the engine finishes. Delivered only when there are no more tool calls or steering messages.
- **Queue mode renamed**: `queueMode` option renamed to `steeringMode`. Added new `followUpMode` option. Both control whether messages are delivered one-at-a-time or all at once.
- **EngineLoopConfig callbacks renamed**: `getQueuedMessages` split into `getSteeringMessages` and `getFollowUpMessages`.
- **Engine methods renamed**:
  - `queueMessage()` → `steer()` and `followUp()`
  - `clearMessageQueue()` → `clearSteeringQueue()`, `clearFollowUpQueue()`, `clearAllQueues()`
  - `setQueueMode()`/`getQueueMode()` → `setSteeringMode()`/`getSteeringMode()` and `setFollowUpMode()`/`getFollowUpMode()`

### Fixed

- `prompt()` and `continue()` now throw if called while the engine is already streaming, preventing race conditions and corrupted state. Use `steer()` or `followUp()` to queue messages during streaming, or `await` the previous call.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Transport abstraction removed**: `ProviderTransport`, `AppTransport`, and `EngineTransport` interface have been removed. Use the `streamFn` option directly for custom streaming implementations.

- **Engine options renamed**:
  - `transport` → removed (use `streamFn` instead)
  - `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
  - `preprocessor` → `transformContext`

- **`AppMessage` renamed to `EngineMessage`**: All references to `AppMessage` have been renamed to `EngineMessage` for consistency.

- **`CustomMessages` renamed to `CustomEngineMessages`**: The declaration merging interface has been renamed.

- **`UserMessageWithAttachments` and `Attachment` types removed**: Attachment handling is now the responsibility of the `convertToLlm` function.

- **Engine loop moved from `@Mooncli/core`**: The `engineLoop`, `engineLoopContinue`, and related types have moved to this package. Import from `@Mooncli/engine-core` instead.

### Added

- `streamFn` option on `Engine` for custom stream implementations. Default uses `streamSimple` from Mooncli-ai.

- `streamProxy()` utility function for browser apps that need to proxy Provider calls through a backend server. Replaces the removed `AppTransport`.

- `getApiKey` option for dynamic API key resolution (useful for expiring OAuth tokens like GitHub Copilot).

- `engineLoop()` and `engineLoopContinue()` low-level functions for running the engine loop without the `Engine` class wrapper.

- New exported types: `EngineLoopConfig`, `EngineContext`, `EngineTool`, `EngineToolResult`, `EngineToolUpdateCallback`, `StreamFn`.

### Changed

- `Engine` constructor now has all options optional (empty options use defaults).

- `queueMessage()` is now synchronous (no longer returns a Promise).
